This can alternatively be replaced with double quotes `df[\"col_name\"]`. In general, anything in quotations is a string in python code. Occassionally, with very ill formatted column names with quotations in the names themselves, you may even need to wrap a name in triple quotes `df[\"\"\"col_name\"\"\"]` . This will rarely happen in this particular context, but is also the general pattern for dealing with messy strings.   \n",

Similarly to tab completion with the command line, this is a primary reason why programers use dashes (-) and underscores (_) in lieu of whitespace in their variable and file names. Also note that no quotations are used when using this format. (The column names have been stored as attributes to the DataFrame object!)"

Rather then import the entire package however, we import only the piece we intend to use (hence the dot notation) and again alias this under the shorthand *plt*.
